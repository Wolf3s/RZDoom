# So what is ZedDoom?
It will be a minimal, stripped-down version of ZDoom 2.8.1 with bug fixes, my additions and my optimisations for many systems.

# Why is it needed?
In my own opinion, ZDoom is too big with too many additions for one person to properly maintain. I'm not interested in pleasing everyone, I don't care about supporting impossibly old systems (XP) or having pointless X64 assembly when our processors are plenty fast enough without it.

So this will contain features I deem 'sensible' for a Doom source port.

# Notices
Master branch is inherently unstable, expect bugs if you compile from there. Feel free to report anything you wish, I'll be happy to work with you on them. Of course, I do debug it myself often.
