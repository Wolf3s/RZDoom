# ZedDoom

# So what is ZedDoom?
It will be a minimal, stripped-down version of ZDoom 2.8.1 with bug fixes, my additions and my optimisations for many systems.

# Why is it needed?
In my own opinion, ZDoom is too big with too many additions for one person to properly maintain.  I'm not interested in pleasing everyone, I don't care about 'having midi themes' or supporting impossibly old systems (XP) or having pointless X64 assembly when our processors are plenty fast enough without it.

So this will contain features I deem 'sensible' for a Doom source port.  Plus fixes for OpenAL on Unix as the implementation there was crooked at best.

# Notices
Master in inherently unstable, expect bugs if you compile from there.  Feel free to report anything you wish, I'll be happy to work with you on them.  Of course, I do debug it myself often.

# But are you a leet programmerz?
Well, I've been programming now for 21 years and I'm an expert in C/C++/Java/Python/Cobol/Kotlin and ARM Assembler and (my favourite) 6502 ASM (C64!).  I'm also well versed in the Windows API, Direct3D 8-11 and of course, all things Unix.  So don't worry, it is in 'extremely' capable hands.
